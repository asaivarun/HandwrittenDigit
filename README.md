# HandwrittenDigit

In this project, recognizing a 28Ã—28 grayscale handwritten digit image and identifying it as a digit among
0, 1, 2, ... , 9. We train the following five classifiers using MNIST digit images.

1. Logistic regression, which implemented using Stochastic Gradient Descent and tuned hyper
parameters.
2. A publicly available multilayer perceptron neural network, trained it on the MNIST digit images and
tuned hyper parameters.
3. A publicly available Random Forest package, trained it on the MNIST digit images and tuned hyper
parameters.
4. A publicly available SVM package, trained it on the MNIST digit images and tuned hyper parameters.
5. Logistic regression, which implemented using Mini Batch Stochastic Gradient Descent and tuned
hyper parameters.
